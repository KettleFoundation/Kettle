To use the fernflower decompiler, just put the fernflower.jar file into the runtime/bin folder.
Only tested with fernflower 0.8.6, other versions may fail.


Hi Searge,

I was told you might be planning to distribute Fernflower as a part of
MCP. It looks like a very nice project to me (excellent work btw :))
so I'm happy to allow the integration. Below you'll find the necessary
supplement to the general license.

Based on the general Fernflower license the following additional
permissions are granted to the project Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP). As
long as the project remains non-commercial it may use, integrate and
distribute every binary version of the decompiler Fernflower in any
desired way as part of MCP tools. Custom patches to Fernflower are
generally possible after a brief consultation with me.

Cheers,
Stiver
