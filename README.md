Since Contigo <s>Thermos</s> is no longer being actively developed or not being developed <u>at all</u> and servers are reduced to using SpongeForge for 1.12+ (Not SpongeVanilla, because spigot), this project is dedicated to renewing the ability for Minecraft servers to use native spigot <s>bukkit</s> plugins along with Forge mods.

### What's Kettle?
Kettle is the next link in the hybrid server chain:
**Kettle** :arrow_right: Contigo :arrow_right: Thermos :arrow_right: Cauldron :arrow_right: MCPC+

Kettle is a fork of Contigo, which, sadly, didn't contribute much outside of minecraft 1.7.10, It's a hybrid (~~craftbukkit~~ spigot forge) server for Minecraft 1.12.2. After Contigo ~~Thermos~~ ~~Cauldron~~ ~~MCPC+~~ was discontinued, Kettle ~~Contigo~~ ~~Thermos~~ ~~Cauldron~~ was created to allow active members of the Minecraft coding community (but mainly a couple of maintainers) to optimize it and provide fixes in a timely manner.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Kettle experience with support for new 1.8+ versions of Minecraft.
