# Kettle

### What's Kettle?
Kettle is the next link in the hybrid server chain:
**Kettle** :arrow_right: Contigo :arrow_right: Thermos :arrow_right: Cauldron :arrow_right: MCPC+

Kettle was initially concieved as a fork of Contigo, but after a few iterations got rid of Contigo's dependencies and can no longer be concidered it's fork, but a standalone hybrid server.

Kettle is dependent on custom Forge and Paper builds, meaning it can run both Craftbukkit/spigot-based plugins and forge-based mods.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Kettle experience with support for new 1.12+ versions of Minecraft.
