Since all of the hybrid server projects are no longer being actively developed or not being developed <u>at all</u> and servers are reduced to using Sponge on 1.12, this project is dedicated to renewing the ability for Minecraft servers to use native Spigot plugins along with Forge mods.

### What's Kettle?
Kettle is the next link in the hybrid server chain:
**Kettle** :arrow_right: Contigo :arrow_right: Thermos :arrow_right: Cauldron :arrow_right: MCPC+

Kettle is a fork of Contigo, which didn't contribute outside of Minecraft 1.7.10. It's a Spigot/Forge hybrid server for Minecraft 1.12.2. After predecessors were discontinued, Kettle was created to allow active members of the Minecraft coding community to optimize it and provide fixes in a timely manner.

We hope to eliminate all issues with Spigot/Forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Kettle experience with support for new 1.8+ versions of Minecraft.
